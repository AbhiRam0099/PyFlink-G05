## Apache Flink

Apache Flink can be described an open-source, unified stream-processing and batch-processing framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation. 
The core of Apache Flink is a distributed streaming data-flow engine written in Java and Scala.
Flink's pipelined runtime system enables the execution of bulk/batch and stream processing programs.
Flink provides a high-throughput, low-latency streaming engine as well as support for event-time processing and state management.
Flink applications are fault-tolerant in the event of machine failure and support exactly-once semantics. 
Programs can be written in Java, Scala, Python, and SQL and are automatically compiled and optimized  into dataflow programs that are executed in a cluster or cloud environment.
