# Description                         
                         
A Big data project to develop Google Page Rank System using Apache Flink with Python.

## Apache Flink

Apache Flink can be described an open-source, unified stream-processing and batch-processing framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation. 
The core of Apache Flink is a distributed streaming data-flow engine written in Java and Scala.
Flink's pipelined runtime system enables the execution of bulk/batch and stream processing programs.
Flink provides a high-throughput, low-latency streaming engine as well as support for event-time processing and state management.
Flink applications are fault-tolerant in the event of machine failure and support exactly-once semantics. 
Programs can be written in Java, Scala, Python, and SQL and are automatically compiled and optimized  into dataflow programs that are executed in a cluster or cloud environment.


## 1. Page rank

PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.

## 2. Algorithm Explanation:

The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called “iterations”, through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value.
